This is a C program I wrote for my job as a Robot Automation Tech. 

I wanted to extract data from our robot programs such as move instructions, speed data, etc. 
I had a working version written in ABB Robotic's language called RAPID, but I re-wrote it in C 
so that we could just paste the program file into a folder and run the code.

!Note this code will not work without a Rapid source file
