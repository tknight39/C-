This is a project for my Assembly and Computer Organization class, spring semester 2020.

The requirements were to make a project using electronic hardware with a raspberry pi, 
the primary language did not matter as long as at least one module was written in ARM Assembly language.

This project is a simple alarm system using motion sensors, and a GUI written in C language.
